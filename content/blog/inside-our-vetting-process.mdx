The promise of a developer marketplace is simple: connect companies with engineers faster than traditional recruiting. The problem is that most marketplaces optimize for quantity over quality. They aggregate resumes, surface keyword matches, and leave the actual evaluation to you.

That defeats the purpose. If you still have to screen 50 candidates to find one good hire, the marketplace has not saved you time — it has just changed the channel.

OctogleHire works differently. Every developer in our network has passed a multi-stage vetting process before they ever appear in a search result. Fewer than 5% of applicants make it through.

Here is exactly how we get there.

## Stage 1: Application and profile review

Every candidate begins with a comprehensive application that goes well beyond a resume upload. We collect:

- **Professional history** with specific focus on the complexity and scale of previous work
- **Technical stack proficiency** — self-assessed and later verified
- **Portfolio and open source contributions** — we review actual code, not descriptions of code
- **Written communication sample** — a short technical explanation that demonstrates clarity and structure
- **Engagement preferences** — full-time, contract, project-based, timezone flexibility

Our review team evaluates each application against role-specific rubrics. We are not looking for brand-name employers or prestigious degrees. We are looking for evidence of meaningful technical work and the ability to communicate about it clearly.

**Approximately 60% of applicants are filtered at this stage.** The most common reasons: insufficient depth of experience for the claimed seniority level, poor written communication, or an application that suggests the candidate is applying broadly without genuine interest.

## Stage 2: Technical assessment

<InlineCta title="Access pre-vetted talent" description="Every developer on OctogleHire has already passed this entire vetting process. Skip months of screening — get 3–5 matched profiles in 48 hours." href="/companies/signup" label="Start Hiring" />

Candidates who pass the initial review complete a timed technical assessment customized to their primary technology stack.

These are not LeetCode problems. We do not ask candidates to reverse a binary tree on a whiteboard or implement a sorting algorithm from memory. Those exercises test a narrow skill that has minimal correlation with actual job performance.

Instead, our assessments mirror the kind of work developers do every day:

- **Build a feature** against an existing codebase with real constraints
- **Debug a production issue** using logs, error traces, and system context
- **Refactor problematic code** with an emphasis on readability and maintainability
- **Design a small system** with clear trade-off documentation

We evaluate four dimensions:

**Problem decomposition** — Does the candidate break the problem into logical steps before writing code? Or do they dive in and hack until something works?

**Code quality** — Is the code readable? Are variable names meaningful? Is the structure consistent? Would a teammate enjoy reviewing this pull request?

**Testing instinct** — Does the candidate write tests without being asked? Do they consider edge cases? Testing behavior is one of the strongest indicators of engineering maturity.

**Communication** — The assessment includes written explanations. Can the candidate articulate why they made specific technical choices?

**Another 50% of remaining candidates are filtered here.** The most common gap: candidates who can write code that works but cannot explain their reasoning or consider the maintainability implications.

## Stage 3: Live technical interview

The final stage is a 60-minute live session with one of our senior engineering reviewers. This is not a quiz. It is a conversation between professionals.

The session has three components:

**System design discussion (20 minutes)** — We present a realistic system design challenge and ask the candidate to think through the architecture. We are evaluating their ability to reason about trade-offs, ask clarifying questions, and communicate their approach. There is no single right answer.

**Code review exercise (20 minutes)** — We share a pull request from a real (anonymized) codebase and ask the candidate to review it. What would they approve? What would they flag? How would they phrase their feedback? This reveals collaboration instincts that a solo coding exercise cannot surface.

**Pair programming (20 minutes)** — We work on a small feature together. The candidate drives. We observe how they navigate ambiguity, whether they ask for help when stuck, and how they respond to suggestions. Remote work requires people who collaborate effectively through a screen.

**Approximately 40% of remaining candidates are filtered here.** The most common reason: strong individual technical skills but weak collaborative signals — difficulty communicating reasoning, reluctance to ask questions, or an inability to incorporate feedback gracefully.

## Stage 4: Ongoing quality assurance

Passing the initial vetting is necessary but not sufficient for long-term membership in the network. We maintain quality through continuous feedback loops:

**Client feedback after every engagement.** Companies provide structured ratings on technical delivery, communication, reliability, and collaboration. This data feeds directly into the developer's network profile.

**Periodic skill re-assessment.** Technologies evolve. A developer who was cutting-edge in 2024 may be falling behind in 2026. We run annual skill refreshes for active members, particularly in fast-moving areas like AI/ML and cloud infrastructure.

**Community standards enforcement.** Developers who receive consistently negative feedback, miss deadlines without communication, or demonstrate unprofessional behavior are removed from the network. There is no probation period for egregious issues.

## What this means for companies

When you browse developers on [OctogleHire](/marketplace), every profile you see has cleared all four stages. You are not looking at raw applications — you are looking at engineers who have been evaluated for exactly the skills that matter in remote collaboration.

This changes the hiring dynamic:

- **Your time-to-hire drops** because you are choosing from a pre-qualified pool instead of running your own multi-week screening process.
- **Interview quality improves** because you can focus on team fit and role-specific depth rather than testing baseline competence.
- **Bad hire rates decrease** because the vetting has already eliminated the most common failure modes.

## What this means for developers

Our vetting process is rigorous, and we know it asks for a meaningful time investment upfront. Here is what developers get in return:

- **Access to quality roles** — the companies hiring through OctogleHire are serious about building strong remote teams
- **Fair, transparent compensation** based on real [market benchmarks](/blog/remote-developer-salary-guide)
- **No resume spam** — you are matched with relevant opportunities, not blasted with irrelevant ones
- **A reputation system that rewards excellence** — strong client feedback opens doors to higher-tier engagements

Vetting is not a gate. It is a quality guarantee. For companies, it means every conversation is worth your time. For developers, it means every opportunity is worth your attention.
