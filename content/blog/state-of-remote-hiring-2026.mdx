## Executive Summary

This report presents original findings from OctogleHire's internal data covering January 2024 through December 2025. Four headline numbers define the current state of remote hiring:

1. **4.8 days average time-to-hire** — from client brief to signed contract, compared to a 42-day industry average for traditional technical recruiting.
2. **52% average cost reduction** — fully-loaded cost of a remote developer placed through OctogleHire versus a local hire in the client's home market.
3. **94% six-month retention rate** — compared to an industry average of approximately 70% for remote technical hires sourced through general channels.
4. **62 countries represented** in active placements, with five countries (India, Brazil, Poland, Ukraine, Argentina) accounting for 54% of all placement volume.

These findings are drawn from 30,247 developer applications reviewed, 1,038 placements completed, and 312 company clients served across the two-year period.

## Methodology

All data in this report comes from OctogleHire's internal placement and client management systems. The dataset covers the period from January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2025.

**Population:** 30,247 individual developer applications submitted to the OctogleHire vetting pipeline. Of these, 3,412 (11.3%) passed all five vetting stages and entered the active talent network. 1,038 developers were matched to client engagements during the reporting period.

**Client base:** 312 companies across 18 industries, headquartered in 24 countries. Company sizes ranged from 3-person seed-stage startups to publicly traded enterprises with 10,000+ employees. The median client had 45 employees and was Series A or B funded.

**Data collection:** Hiring speed was measured from the timestamp of the initial client brief submission to the timestamp of the countersigned contract. Cost savings were calculated by comparing the developer's fully-loaded cost (including OctogleHire's fee) against the median total compensation for an equivalent role, seniority, and tech stack in the client's home market, using data from Levels.fyi, Glassdoor, and Stack Overflow's 2025 Developer Survey. Retention was tracked through monthly client check-ins and contract renewal records.

**Anonymization:** All data has been aggregated and anonymized. No individual developer, company, or engagement is identifiable in this report.

## Key Finding 1: Hiring Speed

The average time from client brief to signed contract across all 1,038 placements was **4.8 business days**. The median was 4.0 days. The 90th percentile was 9 days — meaning 90% of hires were completed in under two weeks.

For context, the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) reports an average time-to-fill for technical roles of 42 business days. LinkedIn's 2025 Global Talent Trends report places the average at 44 days for software engineering roles specifically.

### Time-to-hire by role type

| Role | Avg. Days | Median Days | 90th Percentile |
|------|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Frontend Developer | 4.2 | 3.5 | 8 |
| Backend Developer | 4.6 | 4.0 | 9 |
| Full-Stack Developer | 4.4 | 3.5 | 8 |
| Mobile Developer (iOS/Android) | 5.8 | 5.0 | 11 |
| DevOps / Platform Engineer | 6.3 | 5.5 | 12 |
| Data Engineer | 5.9 | 5.0 | 11 |
| AI / ML Engineer | 7.1 | 6.0 | 14 |
| QA / Test Engineer | 3.8 | 3.0 | 7 |
| Engineering Manager | 8.4 | 7.5 | 16 |

The fastest-filling roles were QA engineers and frontend developers, driven by large talent supply relative to demand. The slowest were engineering managers and AI/ML engineers, reflecting smaller qualified pools and more complex client requirements.

**Why the speed advantage exists:** OctogleHire's model pre-vets developers before client demand materializes. When a brief arrives, matching happens against an already-qualified pool rather than starting a sourcing process from scratch. This inverts the traditional recruiting timeline. The vetting cost is borne upfront and amortized across the network, not charged per search.

## Key Finding 2: Cost Savings

Across all placements, the average fully-loaded cost of a developer hired through OctogleHire was **52% lower** than the equivalent local hire in the client's home market. This figure accounts for the developer's compensation, OctogleHire's placement and management fee, equipment stipends, and any benefits provided.

### Cost reduction by client home market

| Client Market | Avg. Cost Reduction | Median Local Senior Dev Salary | Median OctogleHire Senior Dev Cost |
|---------------|--------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| United States | 57% | $165,000 | $71,000 |
| United Kingdom | 51% | $105,000 (GBP equiv.) | $51,500 |
| Australia | 54% | $115,000 (AUD equiv.) | $52,900 |
| Germany | 48% | $95,000 (EUR equiv.) | $49,400 |
| Canada | 50% | $120,000 (CAD equiv.) | $60,000 |
| Netherlands | 46% | $90,000 (EUR equiv.) | $48,600 |

US-based clients realized the highest absolute savings due to the elevated domestic salary baseline. European clients — particularly in Germany and the Netherlands — saw slightly lower percentage savings because their local markets are already more moderately priced than the US, but still achieved significant reductions.

**Important caveat:** Cost savings do not mean paying developers less than their local market rates. OctogleHire developers are compensated at or above the 75th percentile of their home market. The savings come from the structural difference in cost of living and market rates between the client's country and the developer's country — not from underpaying talent.

### Cost reduction by seniority

| Seniority | Avg. Cost Reduction |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Junior (0-2 years) | 44% |
| Mid (3-5 years) | 50% |
| Senior (5-8 years) | 55% |
| Staff / Lead (8+ years) | 58% |

Savings increase with seniority because the salary gap between high-cost and moderate-cost markets widens at senior levels. A junior developer in San Francisco earns 2-3x their counterpart in Krakow. A staff engineer in San Francisco earns 3-4x.

## Key Finding 3: Retention

The **6-month retention rate** across all placements was **94%**. The **12-month retention rate** was **87%**. Both figures significantly exceed industry benchmarks.

For comparison, the average retention rate for remote technical hires sourced through general job boards and freelance platforms hovers around 70% at six months and 55-60% at twelve months, according to data from Deel's 2025 Global Workforce Report and Remote.com's retention benchmarking study.

### Retention by engagement type

| Engagement Type | 6-Month Retention | 12-Month Retention |
|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| Full-time (dedicated) | 96% | 91% |
| Long-term contract (6+ months) | 93% | 85% |
| Project-based (3-6 months) | 88% | 74% |

Full-time dedicated placements — where the developer works exclusively with one client and is treated as a core team member — showed the strongest retention. Project-based engagements naturally had lower retention due to their defined endpoints, though even here, 74% of developers transitioned into extended engagements with the same client.

### Factors driving retention

We surveyed both developers and clients at the 6-month and 12-month marks to identify what drives retention outcomes. The top factors reported by developers, ranked by frequency:

1. **Fair compensation relative to local market** (cited by 89% of retained developers) — Developers who felt they were paid fairly were 3.2x more likely to stay past 12 months.
2. **Full integration with the client team** (82%) — Developers invited to team standups, retrospectives, and social channels retained at significantly higher rates than those treated as external vendors.
3. **Clear growth path** (71%) — Access to new technologies, increasing responsibility, and explicit discussions about role evolution.
4. **Strong onboarding in the first 30 days** (68%) — Developers who reported a structured onboarding experience were 2.1x more likely to stay past 12 months than those who described their onboarding as ad hoc.
5. **Timezone-compatible collaboration** (61%) — At least 3-4 hours of daily overlap with the core team.

The factor most correlated with early departure was isolation — developers who reported feeling disconnected from the client team at the 3-month mark were 4.7x more likely to leave within 12 months.

## Key Finding 4: Global Talent Distribution

Placements spanned 62 countries across six continents. However, distribution was concentrated, with the top 10 countries accounting for 78% of all placements.

### Top 10 countries by placement volume

| Rank | Country | % of Total Placements | Top Specializations |
|------|---------|----------------------|---------------------|
| 1 | India | 18.2% | Full-stack, Backend, AI/ML |
| 2 | Brazil | 12.4% | Full-stack, Frontend, Mobile |
| 3 | Poland | 9.1% | Backend, DevOps, Data Engineering |
| 4 | Ukraine | 8.3% | Backend, Full-stack, QA |
| 5 | Argentina | 6.0% | Frontend, Full-stack, Mobile |
| 6 | Colombia | 4.8% | Full-stack, Frontend |
| 7 | Nigeria | 4.5% | Frontend, Backend |
| 8 | Philippines | 4.2% | Full-stack, QA |
| 9 | Egypt | 3.7% | Backend, Mobile |
| 10 | Romania | 3.4% | Backend, DevOps |

**Regional trends:**

- **Latin America** (Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Mexico, and others) accounted for 29% of all placements, up from 21% in our 2023 data. Timezone alignment with US clients and strong English proficiency are driving this growth.
- **Eastern Europe** (Poland, Ukraine, Romania, and others) represented 24% of placements. Despite geopolitical disruption in the region, Ukraine's developer community continued to deliver at high rates, and Poland solidified its position as the most consistent Eastern European talent market.
- **South and Southeast Asia** (India, Philippines, and others) accounted for 26% of placements. India remains the single largest source of talent by volume, particularly for AI/ML and backend roles.
- **Africa** (Nigeria, Egypt, Kenya, South Africa, and others) represented 12% of placements — the fastest-growing region year-over-year, with a 67% increase from 2024 to 2025. Nigeria and Egypt are leading this surge, particularly in frontend and backend development.

## Key Finding 5: Most In-Demand Tech Stacks

Client briefs were analyzed to determine the most requested technology stacks. The table below ranks stacks by the number of unique client requests received during the reporting period.

### Top 10 tech stacks by client demand

| Rank | Stack / Technology | % of Client Requests | YoY Change |
|------|-------------------|---------------------|------------|
| 1 | React / Next.js | 34.2% | +4.1% |
| 2 | Python (Django / FastAPI) | 28.7% | +6.3% |
| 3 | Node.js (Express / NestJS) | 26.1% | +1.2% |
| 4 | TypeScript (general) | 24.8% | +5.7% |
| 5 | AWS / Cloud Infrastructure | 19.3% | +2.8% |
| 6 | React Native / Flutter | 14.6% | +3.4% |
| 7 | PostgreSQL / Database Engineering | 13.2% | +1.9% |
| 8 | Kubernetes / Docker / DevOps | 12.8% | +4.5% |
| 9 | Go | 9.4% | +3.1% |
| 10 | AI/ML (PyTorch / TensorFlow / LLMs) | 8.9% | +7.2% |

Note: Percentages sum to more than 100% because most client briefs specify multiple technologies.

**Key observations:**

- **React/Next.js** remains the most requested frontend stack by a wide margin, and its lead grew in 2025. The Next.js App Router ecosystem has matured to the point where it is the default starting point for most new web projects.
- **Python** saw the largest absolute increase in demand, driven almost entirely by AI/ML and data engineering use cases. FastAPI has overtaken Flask as the preferred Python web framework in new client briefs.
- **TypeScript** continues its march toward ubiquity. Nearly a quarter of all briefs now list TypeScript as a hard requirement rather than a nice-to-have.
- **AI/ML** had the highest year-over-year growth rate at 7.2 percentage points. Demand is shifting from research-oriented roles toward production ML engineering — deploying, monitoring, and scaling models rather than training them.
- **Go** crossed the meaningful threshold of representing nearly 10% of all requests, reflecting its adoption in platform engineering and microservices architecture.

## Implications for 2026

Based on the data presented in this report, we identify four trends that will shape remote hiring through 2026 and beyond.

**1. Africa will become a top-3 remote talent region within two years.** The 67% year-over-year growth in African placements is not a blip. Nigeria alone has an estimated 700,000+ professional software developers, with approximately 100,000 entering the workforce annually. Infrastructure improvements (mobile broadband, co-working spaces, developer bootcamps) are compounding this supply. Companies that build sourcing pipelines in Africa now will have a structural talent advantage.

**2. AI/ML hiring will shift from specialists to generalists who can integrate AI.** The most common AI-related request we receive is no longer "hire an ML engineer." It is "hire a senior backend developer who can integrate LLM APIs, set up RAG pipelines, and deploy inference endpoints." The AI skillset is being absorbed into the general full-stack role. By 2027, we expect AI/ML integration capability to be a baseline expectation for senior developers, not a specialization.

**3. Time-to-hire will become the primary competitive metric in recruiting.** In a market where qualified developers receive multiple offers within days, the companies that move fastest win. Our data shows that clients who completed their hiring process in under 5 days had a 91% offer acceptance rate, compared to 64% for those who took more than 10 days. The speed advantage of pre-vetted talent networks over traditional recruiting will continue to widen.

**4. Retention — not cost — will drive the next wave of remote hiring adoption.** Early adopters of remote hiring were primarily motivated by cost savings. The companies we see entering the market now are motivated by retention. They have experienced the revolving door of local hiring in overheated markets like San Francisco and London, where developers change jobs every 14-18 months. Remote developers placed through structured programs like OctogleHire stay nearly twice as long on average.

## Methodology Notes

**Data scope:** This report covers OctogleHire's internal data only. It does not claim to represent the entire remote hiring market. Findings are specific to the OctogleHire platform, its vetting methodology, and its client base.

**Date range:** January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2025. Retention data for placements made in the second half of 2025 reflects 6-month tracking only, as 12-month data is not yet available.

**Anonymization:** All data has been aggregated to group level. No individual developer compensation, no individual client identities, and no specific engagement details are disclosed. Country-level data is reported only where the sample size exceeds 20 placements to prevent identification through small group analysis.

**Limitations:** OctogleHire's client base skews toward technology companies, venture-backed startups, and digital-first enterprises. Results may not generalize to industries with different hiring patterns, compliance requirements, or technical needs. Cost savings calculations depend on the accuracy of third-party salary benchmarking data and may vary based on role specifics not captured in broad category comparisons.
