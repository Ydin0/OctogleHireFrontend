Between December 2025 and January 2026, we surveyed 1,247 software developers in the OctogleHire network across 153 countries. The survey covered compensation expectations, work preferences, retention factors, tooling, and regional differences in how developers experience remote work.

This is not a sentiment poll. Every finding below is grounded in structured responses with validated employment data. The goal is to give hiring companies and engineering leaders a clear, data-backed picture of what developers actually want in 2026 — not what LinkedIn thought leaders assume they want.

Here are the key findings.

## Key highlights

- **73%** of developers say rate transparency is the single most important factor when evaluating a new role
- **89%** prefer fully remote work. Only **4%** want to return to an office full-time
- **62%** cite scope creep as the number one reason they have left or considered leaving a contract
- **67%** prefer async-first communication over real-time collaboration
- Median expected hourly rates have increased **8-12%** year over year across all seniority bands
- Developers in **South Asia** and **Africa** showed the largest year-over-year increase in rate expectations, at **14%** and **16%** respectively

## Compensation: what developers earn and what they expect

Compensation remains the dominant factor in job decisions, but how it is communicated matters almost as much as the number itself. 73% of respondents ranked rate transparency as the most important factor when evaluating a new engagement — ahead of tech stack, team size, and company stage.

The frustration is specific. Developers are not asking for higher rates as much as they are asking to know the rate before they invest time in an interview process. 68% reported having completed multi-round interviews only to discover the budget was significantly below their expectations. The median wasted time per misaligned interview process was 6.5 hours.

### Median hourly rates by seniority (USD, global)

| Seniority | 25th Percentile | Median | 75th Percentile | YoY Change |
|-----------|----------------|--------|-----------------|------------|
| Junior (0-2 yr) | $22 | $35 | $55 | +8% |
| Mid (3-5 yr) | $40 | $60 | $90 | +9% |
| Senior (5-8 yr) | $65 | $95 | $140 | +10% |
| Staff (8+ yr) | $90 | $130 | $185 | +12% |

These figures are global medians. Regional variation is significant — a senior engineer in Western Europe or North America typically falls in the 75th percentile range, while the same seniority level in South Asia or Africa may fall closer to the 25th percentile. But the gap is narrowing. Developers in lower-cost regions are increasingly benchmarking against global rates, not local ones.

### Rate expectations vs. actual rates

41% of developers reported earning below their expected rate. Among those, the median gap between expected and actual compensation was 18%. The primary reasons cited for accepting below-expectation rates were speed of hiring (37%), interesting technical work (29%), and long-term relationship potential (22%).

Developers who reported earning at or above their expected rate were 2.3x more likely to describe themselves as "likely to stay for 12+ months."

## Work preferences: remote is settled, async is rising

The remote work debate is over for this population. 89% of respondents prefer fully remote work. Only 4% expressed a preference for full-time office work. The remaining 7% preferred hybrid arrangements with no more than two office days per week.

More notable is the shift toward async-first communication. 67% of respondents said they prefer async-first workflows, up from 54% in our 2024 survey. This is not passive preference — 43% said they would decline an otherwise attractive role if the company required daily synchronous standups outside their preferred working hours.

### Top work preferences

| Preference | % of Respondents |
|------------|-----------------|
| Fully remote | 89% |
| Async-first communication | 67% |
| Flexible working hours (no fixed schedule) | 64% |
| Written-first decision making (RFCs, docs) | 52% |
| Overlap window of 3 hours or fewer | 47% |
| No mandatory camera-on meetings | 44% |
| 4-day work week option | 38% |
| Hybrid (1-2 office days) | 7% |
| Full-time office | 4% |

The camera-on data point is worth noting. Nearly half of developers prefer meetings where camera use is optional. The reasons cited were reduced fatigue (61%), ability to multitask during low-relevance meetings (28%), and privacy concerns (11%).

## What makes developers stay

Retention is cheaper than recruitment, yet most companies invest disproportionately in hiring pipelines and underinvest in the factors that prevent attrition. We asked developers to rank the factors that make them most likely to stay in a role for 12 or more months.

### Top retention factors

| Factor | % Ranking in Top 3 |
|--------|-------------------|
| Interesting and challenging technical work | 78% |
| Rate transparency and fair compensation | 73% |
| Timezone respect (no meetings outside working hours) | 61% |
| Career growth and learning opportunities | 58% |
| Reliable and on-time payment | 54% |
| Team culture and psychological safety | 49% |
| Autonomy over implementation decisions | 46% |
| Clear project scope and requirements | 41% |
| Modern tech stack | 37% |
| Equity or profit-sharing | 19% |

Two findings stand out. First, interesting work outranks compensation. Developers will accept a modest rate discount for genuinely stimulating technical problems — but they will not accept boredom at any price. Second, reliable payment ranks fifth overall but first among contractors in regions with less stable banking infrastructure. For developers in parts of Africa, South Asia, and Latin America, payment reliability is not a hygiene factor. It is existential.

## What makes developers leave

The inverse question — what drives attrition — reveals a different set of priorities. The top factors that cause developers to leave or seriously consider leaving are dominated by process failures, not compensation.

### Top attrition factors

| Factor | % Ranking in Top 3 |
|--------|-------------------|
| Scope creep and unclear requirements | 62% |
| Late or unreliable payment | 51% |
| Micromanagement and lack of autonomy | 48% |
| No path for growth or learning | 43% |
| Poor communication from leadership | 39% |
| Excessive meetings and synchronous overhead | 36% |
| Toxic team culture | 31% |
| Outdated or frustrating tech stack | 27% |
| Below-market compensation | 24% |

Scope creep is the leading cause of developer dissatisfaction by a wide margin. 62% of respondents placed it in their top three reasons for leaving. The pattern described repeatedly in open-ended responses: a project begins with a defined scope, then requirements expand incrementally without corresponding adjustments to timeline or compensation. By month three, the developer is doing 40-60% more work than originally agreed.

Late payment ranked second overall and first among contractors (compared to full-time employees, who ranked it lower due to more structured payroll). Among developers who reported experiencing late payment, 74% said it immediately triggered a job search.

Micromanagement was the third most cited factor. The behaviors most frequently described: requiring line-by-line justification of time spent, mandating constant screen-sharing or activity monitoring, and overriding technical decisions without domain expertise.

## Tooling and process preferences

We asked developers to rate the tools and processes they find most valuable in their daily work. The results reflect a clear preference for tools that support async workflows and reduce context-switching.

### Most valued tools

| Tool Category | Top Choice | % Using Daily |
|--------------|-----------|---------------|
| Project management | Linear | 52% |
| Project management (runner-up) | Jira | 34% |
| Communication | Slack | 81% |
| Version control | GitHub | 88% |
| Documentation | Notion | 61% |
| Code review | GitHub Pull Requests | 84% |
| Design collaboration | Figma | 47% |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions | 63% |
| Screen recording / async video | Loom | 39% |
| IDE | VS Code / Cursor | 74% |

Linear has overtaken Jira as the preferred project management tool among this developer population, a shift that accelerated over the past 12 months. When asked why, the most common responses cited speed (67%), cleaner UI (54%), and better keyboard shortcuts (41%).

GitHub remains dominant across version control, code review, and CI/CD. 88% of respondents use GitHub daily, compared to 9% for GitLab and 3% for Bitbucket.

### Process preferences

| Process | Preferred by |
|---------|-------------|
| Written RFCs before major changes | 61% |
| Async code reviews (no pairing required) | 72% |
| Sprint-based with 2-week cycles | 44% |
| Kanban / continuous flow | 41% |
| No formal methodology (just ship) | 15% |
| Daily async updates (written standups) | 58% |
| Weekly sync meetings (max 1 hour) | 53% |

The preference for async code reviews (72%) aligns with the broader async-first trend. Developers want to review code on their own schedule, with written context, rather than in synchronous pairing sessions. This does not mean pairing is rejected entirely — 28% still value it — but it is no longer the default expectation.

## Regional insights

Developer priorities vary meaningfully by region. While compensation and remote work are universal concerns, the relative weight of secondary factors differs based on local market conditions and cultural norms.

### South Asia (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka)

Rate growth is the dominant concern. Developers in South Asia reported the highest dissatisfaction with current compensation (47% rated it below expectations) and the strongest year-over-year increase in rate expectations (14%). The talent market in this region is maturing rapidly — senior engineers in India and Pakistan increasingly benchmark against global rates rather than local ones, and they are willing to change roles to close the gap.

Payment reliability also ranks higher in this region (ranked 2nd, compared to 5th globally), reflecting both banking infrastructure challenges and past experiences with delayed payments from international clients.

### Eastern Europe (Poland, Ukraine, Romania, Czech Republic)

Tech stack variety is the distinguishing factor. Developers in Eastern Europe were 1.8x more likely than the global average to rank "modern and diverse tech stack" as a top-three retention factor. This region has a strong tradition of computer science education, and developers here tend to be more opinionated about technology choices.

Rate expectations in Eastern Europe remain high relative to other non-Western markets, with senior engineers expecting $65-100/hr — approaching Western European rates in some cases.

### Latin America (Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Colombia)

Timezone alignment with US companies is the most valued differentiator. 71% of Latin American respondents ranked timezone overlap as a top-three factor when evaluating roles (compared to 47% globally). This reflects the region's competitive advantage — Latin American developers can offer real-time overlap with US teams during standard business hours, something that developers in Asia and Eastern Europe cannot easily provide.

Currency stability is also a notable concern, particularly in Argentina and Colombia. 38% of Latin American respondents preferred to be paid in USD or USDT rather than local currency.

### Africa (Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, Egypt, Ghana)

Payment reliability is the number one factor, cited by 69% of respondents as a top-three priority (compared to 54% globally). This is a direct response to market conditions — developers in this region report the highest incidence of late or missed payments from international clients (23% have experienced it in the past 12 months, compared to 11% globally).

Despite this, developer optimism in Africa is the highest of any region. 82% of African respondents said they expect their income to grow in the next 12 months, compared to 61% globally. The talent pool is growing rapidly, and developers here are increasingly visible in global hiring pipelines.

## Implications for hiring companies

The data points to specific, actionable changes that companies can make to attract and retain remote developers more effectively.

**1. Publish rate ranges in job postings.** 73% of developers prioritize rate transparency above all other factors. Companies that hide compensation until late in the process are losing qualified candidates at the top of the funnel. Post the range. Absorb the minor negotiation disadvantage. The efficiency gain in pipeline quality more than compensates.

**2. Define scope rigorously and renegotiate when it changes.** Scope creep is the number one attrition driver. This is a project management problem, not a developer attitude problem. When requirements expand, the timeline and compensation should be revisited explicitly. A 5-minute conversation about adjusted expectations prevents a 3-month replacement cycle.

**3. Default to async, protect synchronous time.** 67% of developers prefer async-first workflows. This does not mean eliminating meetings — it means making meetings the exception rather than the default. Write first, meet only to resolve what writing could not. For teams spanning multiple timezones, this is not optional.

**4. Pay on time, every time.** For 54% of developers globally — and 69% in Africa — payment reliability is a top-three retention factor. Late payment is not a minor inconvenience. It is a trust violation that triggers immediate job searching. Set up automated payment systems, build payment buffers, and treat on-time payment as a non-negotiable operational requirement.

**5. Invest in growth paths for contractors.** 43% of developers cited "no growth path" as a top attrition factor. This is not limited to full-time employees. Contract developers want to deepen their skills, take on more complex projects, and increase their rates over time. Companies that offer learning budgets, gradually increasing scope, and clear rate progression for long-term contractors will retain them significantly longer than those that treat every engagement as transactional.
