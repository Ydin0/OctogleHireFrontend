The global distribution of software engineering talent has shifted dramatically over the past decade. A generation ago, the assumption was that the best developers lived in a handful of cities in the United States and Western Europe. That assumption was always wrong, but it was at least plausible when most engineering jobs required physical presence.

Remote work demolished that constraint. In 2026, companies hiring the [best engineering teams](/blog/why-engineering-teams-are-going-remote) are sourcing from every continent. Here is where the talent is, what makes each region distinctive, and what to consider when hiring there.

## Eastern Europe

**Key markets:** Poland, Ukraine, Romania, Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Serbia, Croatia

**Technical strengths:** Eastern Europe has one of the highest concentrations of competitive programming talent in the world. The region excels in systems programming, backend development, DevOps, and algorithmic problem-solving. Computer science education is rigorous and widely available, with strong university programs in Warsaw, Kyiv, Bucharest, and Prague.

**Timezone alignment:** UTC+1 to UTC+3. Excellent overlap with Western European business hours and 4-6 hours of overlap with US Eastern.

**Compensation ranges:** Senior engineers typically command $60-100K annually, depending on specialization and country. Poland and Czech Republic trend toward the higher end. Ukraine, Romania, and Bulgaria are more cost-effective while maintaining comparable quality.

**Cultural considerations:** Direct communication style. Strong work ethic. Engineers in this region tend to be opinionated about technical decisions — in a good way. They will push back on poor architecture choices rather than silently implementing them.

**Hiring difficulty:** Moderate and increasing. The region is well-known and competition for top talent is rising. Companies that offer [competitive compensation](/blog/remote-developer-salary-guide) and genuine remote-first culture have an advantage.

## Latin America

**Key markets:** Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Colombia, Chile, Uruguay

**Technical strengths:** Latin America has a rapidly maturing tech ecosystem with particular strength in full-stack web development, mobile development, and increasingly in data engineering and ML. Brazil and Argentina have vibrant startup scenes that produce battle-tested engineers accustomed to building with limited resources.

**Timezone alignment:** UTC-3 to UTC-6. Near-perfect overlap with US business hours, which is the single biggest advantage of this region for US-based companies. A team in Buenos Aires can attend a 10am standup in New York without inconvenience.

**Compensation ranges:** Senior engineers range from $50-85K annually. Argentina and Brazil sit at the higher end due to strong demand. Colombia and Mexico offer excellent value at $40-65K for senior talent.

**Cultural considerations:** Collaborative and relationship-oriented. Teams from Latin America tend to invest in interpersonal dynamics, which can be a significant advantage in remote settings where social cohesion requires intentional effort. Communication style is warm but professional.

**Hiring difficulty:** Moderate. The US timezone advantage has made the region highly competitive in recent years, but the talent pool is large and growing. University enrollment in CS and engineering programs is increasing across the region.

## South and Southeast Asia

**Key markets:** India, Vietnam, Philippines, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Indonesia, Sri Lanka

**Technical strengths:** India remains the world's largest producer of software engineers by volume, with particular depth in enterprise Java, cloud infrastructure, and AI/ML. Vietnam has emerged as a powerhouse for mobile and game development. The Philippines and Pakistan have growing freelance ecosystems with strong English proficiency.

**Timezone alignment:** UTC+5 to UTC+8. Minimal overlap with US business hours, significant overlap with European and Middle Eastern markets. This makes the region ideal for [async-first teams](/blog/building-async-engineering-teams) or companies operating across Asian markets.

**Compensation ranges:** The widest range of any region. Senior engineers in India command $42-72K at top-tier companies but as low as $25-40K in smaller cities. Vietnam and Philippines senior rates are $30-55K. Bangladesh and Pakistan offer $20-40K for experienced engineers.

**Cultural considerations:** Varies significantly by country. Indian engineers, particularly from top-tier companies and IITs, operate at a caliber comparable to any global market. The key differentiator is vetting — the volume of candidates makes careful [screening essential](/blog/inside-our-vetting-process).

**Hiring difficulty:** Low on volume, high on signal. The challenge in this region is not finding candidates — it is finding exceptional candidates in a very large pool. Working with a platform that has rigorous vetting is not optional here; it is a prerequisite.

## Africa

**Key markets:** Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, Egypt, Ghana, Rwanda, Morocco

**Technical strengths:** Africa's tech ecosystem is the fastest growing in the world. Nigeria's Andela alumni network alone has produced thousands of world-class engineers. Kenya's Silicon Savannah has a thriving fintech sector. South Africa has mature enterprise engineering talent. Egypt and Morocco have strong European-facing development communities.

**Timezone alignment:** UTC+0 to UTC+3. Excellent overlap with European business hours and reasonable overlap with US Eastern.

**Compensation ranges:** Senior engineers typically command $35-60K. South Africa trends higher. Nigeria, Kenya, and Egypt offer exceptional value at $25-45K for senior talent with production experience at scale.

**Cultural considerations:** Entrepreneurial and resourceful. Engineers from African markets often have experience building systems under infrastructure constraints — unreliable internet, power fluctuations, limited cloud availability — which produces unusually resilient and pragmatic engineers. English proficiency is high in Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, Ghana, and Rwanda.

**Hiring difficulty:** Low and decreasing. This is the most underleveraged region in global hiring. Companies that establish a presence here now will have a first-mover advantage as competition inevitably increases.

## Western Europe

**Key markets:** Portugal, Spain, Germany, Netherlands, UK, France, Italy

**Technical strengths:** Deep expertise across all domains, with particular strength in fintech, automotive software, and enterprise SaaS. Germany's engineering culture is methodical and documentation-heavy, which translates well to remote environments. Portugal has become a hub for startup engineering talent.

**Timezone alignment:** UTC+0 to UTC+2. Perfect for European-market companies and decent overlap with US Eastern.

**Compensation ranges:** Senior engineers command $80-140K depending on country. Portugal and Spain are more cost-effective at $65-100K. Germany, Netherlands, and UK sit at the higher end.

**Cultural considerations:** Strong labor protections in most countries. Engineers expect structured processes, clear expectations, and work-life balance. The quality baseline is high, but so are the expectations around company culture and professional development.

**Hiring difficulty:** High. This is a mature market with intense competition, particularly for senior talent. Companies need compelling value propositions beyond compensation to attract candidates.

## How to choose the right region

The decision depends on three factors:

**1. Timezone requirements.** If you need real-time collaboration during US business hours, Latin America is the obvious choice. If your team is async-first, geography becomes nearly irrelevant.

**2. Budget.** If you are extending runway, South/Southeast Asia and Africa offer the strongest value. If compensation is not the primary constraint, hire from wherever the best candidate happens to be.

**3. Specialization.** Need systems programmers? Eastern Europe. Need full-stack web developers for a US-timezone product team? Latin America. Need AI/ML engineers? India. Need resilient engineers who have built under real-world constraints? Africa.

The best approach is to not constrain yourself to a single region. Build a globally distributed team that draws strength from diversity of perspective, timezone coverage, and complementary specializations.

The world's best engineers do not all live in one city. They never did. The difference in 2026 is that you can actually hire them.
